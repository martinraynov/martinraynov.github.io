A usefull command in linux is the `top` command that provides a real-time view of the running processes on your machine. 

`ctop` is the same but for containers. It allows you to check the condensed overview of real-time metrics for multiple containers ! Very usefull when you want to see how your containers are using the provisioned ressources.

`ctop` can be run locally on different OS (OS X, Linux, Windows) or as a docker container.
